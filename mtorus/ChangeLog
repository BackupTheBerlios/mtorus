	* mtorus-element.el: (mtorus-topology)
	- added mtorus topology. this is most elementary
	as the navigation on the torus depends on this
	(currently only trivial topologies are available)

	* mtorus.el:
	- added frontend (i.e. interactive) funs to access the
	newer backend
	- bugfixed obarray issue when trying to create elements
	without having created types

	* mtorus-element.el: second (even more abstract) approach to
	element and type handling.

	* ChangeLog: added ChangeLog file :)

	* mtorus.el: added a basic set of interactive functions to
	create rings and elements

	* mtorus-rings.el: abstracted the creation of rings and
	elements a little more.
	- elements now have to be created via `mtorus-ring-create-element'
	- elements have their own keeper variable `mtorus-elements'
	- elements are not identified by their content but by a cookie
