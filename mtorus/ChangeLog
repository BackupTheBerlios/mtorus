	element and type handling.

	* ChangeLog: added ChangeLog file :)

	* mtorus.el: added a basic set of interactive functions to
	create rings and elements

	* mtorus-rings.el: abstracted the creation of rings and
	elements a little more.
	- elements now have to be created via `mtorus-ring-create-element'
	- elements have their own keeper variable `mtorus-elements'
	- elements are not identified by their content but by a cookie
