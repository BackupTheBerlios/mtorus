* MTorus

MTorus provides functionality for switching buffers quickly and general navigation issues within emacs.<br/>
I hope the logo describes everything ;).

** New Generation MTorus

Yes, it's true!
The wonderful [[EmacsWiki#SwitchingBuffers][buffer switching]] technique provided by mtorus
is currently revised and will be properly divided into a backend/frontend combination.

Though we do not plan to establish more than one frontend this is seemingly the
best solution in order to provide comfortable development and support.

For a more technical, but not so descriptive version of this page look at the
Commentary: header in the file mtorus-element.el and the various comments
throughout the file.


** GettingMtorus

You can be witness of the growth of the new generation MTorus.
See the [[GettingMtorus][download page]] for that.

For the ones who want a working mtorus, see
